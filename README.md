# Country Transportation Database

# Overview  

This project aims to develop a comprehensive transportation database model for a country, encompassing various modes such as sea, air, road, mobile transportation, metro, etc. The system is designed to issue unique transportation cards for citizens, recording their transportation histories, searches, and preferences. The database supports both macro and micro-level queries.  

The project focuses on concretely building a database, commencing with the identification of data requirements from seven distinct transportation providers: Turkish Airlines, TCDD, MartÄ± Tech, Obilet, IDO, IZBAN, and Yolcu360. Subsequently, the project entails the creation of individual EER diagrams for each provider, followed by their integration to construct a unified and comprehensive database. The subsequent steps involve transforming the conceptual design into a relational model and, ultimately, realizing the physical model of the database.  

The source files encompass distinct EER diagrams for each provider, along with the amalgamated diagram representing their integration. Additionally, the source files contain data entries, triggers, check constraints, and diverse query examples of varying complexities, all incorporated for comprehensive testing purposes.
